\cdpchapter{Abstract}

The great improvements achieved in recent years in the hardware increasing its processing and storage capacity have led to fields such as Deep Learning have undergone a great evolution and have become the most powerful tools for extracting information from data.

This project aims to implement a system based on big data architecture that feeds with a constant flow of information a set of neural networks for the prediction of securities of currencies in the Forex market. For this purpose, our proposed solution is based on already consolidated tools such as \textbf{Apache Spark} and \textbf{TensorFlow}.

At the same time the system pretends to be a study on the viability of the precision of the predictions of the values knowing only the historical of the same ones, thanks to the capacity of abstraction and recognition of patterns of the \textbf{artificial neural networks}. As part of the study, two types of networks will be implemented: recurrent networks and convolutional networks.
